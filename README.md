## Projects
**[COVID-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/beckettschlag/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID-19%20Data%20Exploration.sql)**

The objective of this project was to explore the data of COVID-19 infections and vaccinations by country and/or continent to understand how they were affected. After understanding how each country/continent was affected by COVID-19 I used SQL to find how they were affected by the release of a vaccine. I used these quries to make a dashboard comparing these statistics and predicting the potential future of the average percentage of the population infected.
