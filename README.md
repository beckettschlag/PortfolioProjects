**[Delaware Health Code Violations EDA](https://github.com/beckettschlag/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Delaware%20Health%20Code%20Violations%20EDA)**

This project aims to clean, transform, and analyze data relating to health code relations in the state of Delaware to answer hypothetical questions you may be asked while working as a Data Analyst for the Department of Health. Through this project, we found which cities have the most health code violations, what kind of violations are most common, and any monthly trends among these violations. Through a series of visualizations, we could summarize our findings and find answers to our questions seeking answers.

**Skills used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Data cleaning, Data Visualization, Data Transformation


**[Data Science Salary EDA](https://github.com/beckettschlag/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Salaries%20EDA)**

As someone seeking entry into the data science industry, I've always wondered what the advantages were of working remotely vs in-person or hybrid. Through this exploratory data analysis, I sought to answer a series of questions one might have in my position to understand the financial benefits of working remotely. I created multiple graphs, providing some key insight on what to expect during a job search in this field and what to expect in the future, and I concluded which job type found the most success in their data science career.

**Skills used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization


**[COVID-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/beckettschlag/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID-19%20Data%20Exploration.sql)**

The objective of this project was to explore the data on COVID-19 infections and vaccinations by country and/or continent to understand how they were affected. After understanding how each country/continent was affected by COVID-19 I used SQL to find how they were affected by the vaccine release. I used these queries to create a dashboard comparing these statistics and predicting the potential future of the average percentage of the population infected.
